summary: "An all-girls cybersecurity tournament that my team and I placed State Second in"

[Girls Go Cyberstart](https://medium.com/girls-go-cyberstart) was one of the first computer science-related competitions I participated in and my first delve into cybersecurity. Still being new to programming in Java with even less experience in collaborative coding, it was a daunting task for me and my team of three other girls.

The competition was based on advancing through increasingly difficult levels and puzzles that were worth some amount of points. The site was open for 6 days; competitors were allowed to work through each of the different sections on their own time. At the time, some of my team members were much more familiar with coding and programming itself, while I was still freshly interested in cryptography. Thus, the beginning of the tournament, I was tasked with mostly such; solving ciphers and cracking encoded messages on the sites provided. As days went on, I was able to become familiar with Java as well as Python through sheer exposure.  Being able to rely on my other, older team members in areas where I fell short, and them relying on me for the certain puzzles they can't crack worked like a lovely harmony of sorts. It was a great opportunity to experience first-hand the closeset example of working in a security-oriented company, albeit on a time crunch.

We had joined this competition on a whim, it was the first year that Girls Go CyberStart launched, and we thought it would be a fun thing to try. We did not expect to earn second place, nor did we expect to be invited by the governor for congratulations. I am grateful for my team, and for everything that made it possible to have this experience. It showed me a glimpse of what my future could look like.

Cotton is a horror-style text-based adventure game I developed using the functions and macros built from The Wizard's Game in [Conrad Barski's Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/). Slightly more interesting and convoluted! (It is not that scary.)

To give you a flavor of the game, here is an excerpt from one run:

<hr>

<pre>
You open your eyes, and you are greeted by an unfamiliar ceiling.
Startled, you get to your feet and quickly scan your surroundings. It's
dark except for the stream of light coming from a crack on the only boarded
window in the room. You try to peek through the crack, but you cannot see
anything. You wonder where you are and who could have possibly brought you here.

<--------------------help------------------------>
Enter quit or one of the following commands -
Weld light look walk pickup inventory help h ?
<------------------------------------------------>

look
The room is a picture of decay with only a faded number identifying it as room-4. The bed you were
 lying on is stained with what looks like dried blood. Could it be your blood? No - it is not. The
 only way out of the room aside from the door to the corridor is a window that is boarded shut. It
 looks like it has been like that for decades. There is a door going west from here. You see a candle
 on the floor. You see a match on the floor.

pickup candle
- you are now carrying the candle -

pickup match

light match candle

The candle is now lit. It illuminates everything in the room.

walk west
The corridor is lit with the candle. It is so long that you cannot see to the end. You notice that
 there are words written on the wall. There is a door going east from here. There is a way going north
 from here. There is a door going south from here.
